# Overly Fragile Relationships
A small game by Allemansrätten about the transience of human relationships.

- Pick one or more friends to join you on nights out.
- Try to keep your friendship network alive.
- You lose if one of your friends begins to hate somebody.

People get upset if you don’t go out with them for a longer time
or when they have to spend time with someone they don’t like
or when they have a generally bad time.
… It’s complex.

Created as part of 46th [Ludum dare](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/overly-fragile-relationships), [playable here](https://allemansratten.github.io/overly-fragile-relationships/dist/).
