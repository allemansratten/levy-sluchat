Medailonky

# Alex
- Her humor may come off as crude initially, but deep down, she really cares about all of her friends.

#Beatrice
- Jokingly flirts with all of her friends, but is afraid to commit to a relationship. She once told you it makes her quite upset.

#Cecil
- A chill, introverted guy, though you have seen him blow up before. He's actually also quite sporty.

#Dan
- He's an athletic extrovert, seems to leave a good first impression on people. His confidence does sometimes border on arrogance, though.

#Eric
- Raised in a religious household, he does his best to get along with people. You haven't seen him in a relationship before.

#Flavie
- One of the most caring people you've ever met. She expects the same from everybody else, though this often lets her down.
